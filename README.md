# Menu Vue

In recent years, we have seen businesses rapidly increase their use of technology to improve efficiency and minimize physical interactions. In todayâ€™s contactless world, something as simple as browsing a restaurant menu is now often done by scanning a QR code with your smartphone. Menu Vue is a service that allows businesses to build and share their menus, generate QR codes to view those menus, and give customers the ability to provide feedback on items.

Although other services already provide QR code menus, Menu Vue implements additional user interactions that provide both customers and business owners with valuable information. Customers can leave feedback about items, allowing other customers to make a more informed decision on what to order, and letting business owners know what needs improving.
